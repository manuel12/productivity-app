# Current Issues

## Todos

- Instead of 40 char limit it can be better to simply show max 40 chars on the todo.
- Todo list should be scrollable and not be constantly extending the page down.
- There should be a way to edit todos.
- Completed todos should dissapear from list(probably).
- There should be a counter of how many todos have been completed per day.
